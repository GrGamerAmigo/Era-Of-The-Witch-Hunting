## Overview
"We All Lift Together" is a song sung by the banished dwarves of [[Ironhold Mines]]. It reflects their unity and resilience in the face of hardship and exploitation.

## Lyrics
Cold, the air and water flowing  
Hard, the land we call our home  
Push, to keep the dark from coming  
Feel the weight of what we owe

This, the song of sons and daughters  
Hide, the heart of who we are  
Making peace to build our future  
Strong, united, working 'til we fall

And we all lift, and we're all adrift  
Together, together  
Through the cold mist, 'til we're lifeless  
Together, together

## Role in the Campaign
- **Session 2**: The party hears the song as they enter Ironhold, setting the tone for the dwarvesâ€™ plight.
