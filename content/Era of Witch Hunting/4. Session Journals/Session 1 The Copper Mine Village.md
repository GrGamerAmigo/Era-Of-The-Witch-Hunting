## Summary
The players arrived in a small village on the continent of [[Thalan|Land of Mysteries]], where they heard rumors about the [[Dead Zones of Nature|Nature’s Curse]]. At the village tavern, they witnessed a mysterious encounter between an [[Alahar|Angel]], a [[Meleborn|Drow Ranger]], and a [[Miriel|Elf Warrior]]. After the Angel left, a mine collapse occurred, and the players joined Meleborn and Miriel to rescue trapped miners. Inside the mine, they fought copper-eating insects and faced an [[The Assassin|Assassin]] sent by Alahar. After the battle, the group retreated to a log cabin, where Meleborn and Miriel revealed their story and asked the players to help them warn their friend, [[Dothir|Gnome Mage]], who lives in a tower on a distant island. The players agreed, and the journey began.
